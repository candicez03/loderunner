# loderunner
loderunner pygame implementation

Instructions:
- run lodeRunnder.py to play the game (for keyboard controls and rules see help.txt)
- run recognizer.py to generate a map from a screenshot (for example, img1-5.jpg; this generator is currently slightly sketchy, but you can edit the map based on the output)
